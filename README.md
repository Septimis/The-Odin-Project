# [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

## Goal
The reason I am going through The Odin Project is to solidify my understanding in full stack web development.  More specifically, I would like to get my front-end work to an acceptable level of professionalism and form a solid foundation in back end development as well as database structure.  This course is to supplement my course work at Utah State University.
